        <h1>Advent of Code 2024</h1>
        <p>It's December and time for this year's <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/about">advent of code</a>! I
            will be attempting to complete this coding challenge using Javascript, and building a simple site to
            showcase the results for each day.</p>
        <p>Our challenge this year relates to the Chief Historian, who is missing. We need to look in 50 different
            places for him, and collect 50 stars by 25th December by completing the coding challenges. He will be in one
            of the 50 locations.</p>
        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <div class="day_entry">
            <h3 class="top">Challenge 1</h3>
            <p>The first day begins! The Chief Historian was planning his trip before he disappeared, and has left
                location IDs of the various significant places he may visit. We have two similar lists of the location
                IDs, and must find the total distance between the list entries. We do this by finding the lowest entries
                in each list, finding the distance between them, then comparing the next two entries and so on. The
                distances between each entry are then added up to find the total distance between the two lists. I have
                converted the input data to JSON, stored in the <code>data/</code> directory.</p>
            <div class="code_and_button_block">
                <pre id="day1Challenge1Result" class="code_answer_block"></pre>
                <button type="button" onclick="runDay1Challenge1()">Run the code</button>
            </div>
            <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
            <p>So, it turns out some of the entries were misinterpreted handwriting... but perhaps the
                frequently-occuring IDs are the real IDs? Now we calculate a score based on the number of times each
                (non-unique) ID in the left list occurs in the right list. Values are multiplied together.</p>
            <div class="code_and_button_block">
                <pre id="day1Challenge2Result" class="code_answer_block"></pre>
                <button type="button" onclick="runDay1Challenge2()">Run the code</button>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <div class="day_entry">
            <h3 class="top">Challenge 1</h3>
            <p>Our second location... now we have to analyse some data in a nuclear power plant. The data consists of
                sets of numbers, and safe values either increase or decrease across the whole set, while also not
                changing by more than 3 per step, and at least 1 per step. The data has been formatted as JSON and is in
                the <code>data/</code> directory.</p>
            <div class="code_and_button_block">
                <pre id="day2Challenge1Result" class="code_answer_block"></pre>
                <button type="button" onclick="runDay2Challenge1()">Run the code</button>
            </div>
            <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
            <p>The results we calculated are correct, except a single bad entry can be permitted / ignored per set of
                levels readings. Let's run through the readings again, but for any set of levels that seems wrong, run
                through them all and drop one level at each location in the array, and see if the readings are now safe.
            </p>
